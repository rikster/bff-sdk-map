\cart

<hr/>
<p>
The cart.ts file contains TypeScript code for managing cart operations in a web application. Here&apos;s a brief overview based on the initial portion of the file:
<br/>

<br/>
Imports: The file begins by importing various types and classes, such as endpoints 
<br/>
(AddToCartEndpoint, ApplyDiscountEndpoint, GetCartEndpoint, RemoveDiscountEndpoint, UpdateCartLineQuantityEndpoint) from a cart.types file, the SdkEndpoint class from a sdk-endpoint file, and the Cart type from a types directory. These imports suggest the file&apos;s dependencies on other parts of the application architecture for defining API endpoints, types, and utility functions.

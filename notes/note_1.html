<br/>
This directory contains the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Software Development Kit (SDK) which is a set of tools and libraries designed to facilitate communication between the frontend of the application and its backend services. 
<br/>

<br/>
The BFF layer abstracts the complexities of direct backend communication, providing a simpler and more tailored API surface for frontend consumption. 
<br/>

<br/>
It might include definitions for various API endpoints (like the cart API we explored earlier), hooks for accessing these APIs (useBff, useBffClient), and utilities for handling SDK-related tasks such as error handling, logging, and data transformation.

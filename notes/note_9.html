/dispatch:
<br/>

<br/>
This directory is to state management or event dispatching within the application. 
<br/>

<br/>
It might contain utilities or hooks that allow components to dispatch actions or events, which are then handled by reducers or listeners to update the application&apos;s state. 
<br/>

<br/>
This pattern is common in applications using Redux or similar state management libraries (NO TUSED HERE), but it could also be a custom implementation specific to this application&apos;s architecture (TRUe)
